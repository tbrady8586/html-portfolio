<h1>The Best Movies According to Trisha</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
<hr/>
<h3>The Notebook</h3>
<p>This is one of my favorite love stories. I really enjoy the feel of the movie. From the clothes to the scenary. My husband and I watched this in our early dating years and it is still one that we enjoy to watch together and often quote. </p>
<h3>The Princess Bride</h3>
<p>This is a classic! The movie is one that I have loved since I was young and have been able to share with my own daughter. Who is also now a huge fan of the movie. It is a love stories with many memorable quotes and keeps you laughing.</p>
<h3>Over the Moon</h3>
<p>I love this movie for the deep emotions it covers under the disguise of a kids movie. When I need a good cry this is the movie I watch. It shows the deep struggle of depression and how depression can keep you from enjoying life. It focuses in on how loss of a loved one can really impact all aspects of your life and make you miss out on those still in your life that want to love you. </p>
